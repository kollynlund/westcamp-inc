	  	WestCAMP is a 501(c)(3) non-profit Utah corporation, established in 1993. Its mission is to improve the performance, competitiveness, and profitability of products and processes for Utah business enterprises. The Manufacturing Extension Partnership of Utah (MEP Utah) is a wholly owned division of WestCAMP, formulated to specifically provide such services to Utah's manufacturing industry. In accomplishing its mission, since 1995 WestCAMP has fulfilled and continues to fulfill several contracts with state and federal economic development agencies including the U.S. Department of Commerce and the State of Utah Governor's Office of Economic Development.</p>

	  <h1>Unique Business Approach</h1>
	  <p class="main-text">WestCAMP is fairly unique in its basic business approach to contract and service delivery. Unlike most consulting and contract fulfillment organizations, WestCAMP does not pursue delivery of a specific, pre-designed or pre-determined product or service for any of its prospective economic development or business improvement clients. Instead, WestCAMP has focused its expertise on being able to perform comprehensive assessments of each of its client's various business activities and then to identify specific, quantifiable opportunities for significant, rapid, permanent and sustainable improvement. WestCAMP, and particularly MEP Utah, work closely with each of its clients to identify the most proficient and cost effective resources to accomplish the needed improvements, and that will appropriately balance the cost and return to the business enterprise from implementing any such proposed improvements. WestCAMP has therefore, for the past decade, been involved in a broad spectrum of product, process, and service improvements.</p>

		<p class="main-text">
			WestCAMP, through its MEP Utah division, is one of some 63 Centers throughout the U.S. currently under contract to the Department of Commerce to provide such services. It is noteworthy that at the close of 2003, WestCAMP's MEP Utah program was identified as the service provider with the #1 client satisfaction rating among all such services nationally, and was also rated as #4 nationally in positive, quantifiable impact for its clients. It is also noteworthy that the U.S. Department of Commerce's Census Bureau independently surveyed MEP's clients in Utah, and in a compiled report issued in 2002 found that for the preceding evaluation period, MEP had caused to be created or retained some 1,055 jobs, helped companies achieve $121.5 million in new or retained sales, and created a spend of $6.5 million in new equipment and training for modernization. Obviously, the return on the public investment in WestCAMP/MEP Utah for economic development services is significant.
