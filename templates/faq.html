    <accordion-group heading="WHY IS THE PROGRAM SO INEXPENSIVE?">
      The real cost for us to operate this program, including instruction, meals, accommodations, and all other related expenses, is more than EUR 9,000 per student. In future years, we may ask students to pay a larger portion of this cost to attend. However, this year, participants are asked only to pay EUR 1,000 and any who can't afford to pay can receive a scholarship. Why do we do this? Because we want to offer this program to EVERY young man and young woman of character and professional ability who wishes to become an outstanding leader in their community. How can we afford to do this? We know our program will help you be successful and we believe in you. We believe that if you follow the principles we teach, your business will be successful. In exchange for your ability to attend this program at a reduced price, we invite you to offer us a small amount of ownership in the business you create during the program. This way, our success is dependent on helping you be as successful as possible.
